## Introduction to this repo
My personal process of revisiting essential topics and techniques in C++.

I used C++ when studying data structure quite a little bit, but never officially learnt it before. Moreover, I got a lot of practice of C coding in previous projects. In this repo I will learn by myself
essential topics in C++. 

This is written with ___VS 2022 Community___ and inside this solution, every project is a selfcontained topic. I will try anything helpful: runoob tutorials, book 
like _'C++ primer'_, _'Essential C++'_, and so on. If things goes well I will learn libraries about __robotics dynamics__ later. Let's see how far I can go, now that I have quite some 
leisure time in fourth year of my undergraduate.

I don't think this will be helpful for any people other than me LOL, but I'll try to keep a record of these things.
